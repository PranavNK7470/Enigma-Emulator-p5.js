This is an emulator for the Enigma machine , made in javascript using the p5 js library.<br>
This particular one emulates a three rotor Enigma machine (Source : https://www.101computing.net/enigma-machine-emulator).<br>
The Enigma machine was a message scrambling machine famously used in WWII by the German Military for encrypting the messages they send.<br>
What made it special was that the same letter would not be repeated in the encrypted message if they original letter had repeating letters.<br>
Combining all the combinations from the rotors and the plugboard, it had about 159 Quintillion (10^18) combinations.<br>
Alan Turing famously cracked this machine and helped the allied powers win the war.<br>


Ps:
This was made as a winter holiday project for 2nd year of computer science.
I am pretty new to javascript and the p5 library and all thanks to Daniel Schiffman(Youtube: The coding train), i was able to pickup the basics and make this project.
